ref: [cmake docs -> execute process](https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/command/execute_process.html)

execute_process is like adding a custom command except it runs during configuration time where as the custom command runs during build time. 

this is useful for when you need targets or files before build time, otherwise its best to use [[add_custom_command]]

```cmake
execute_process(COMMAND <cmd1> [<arguments>]
                [COMMAND <cmd2> [<arguments>]]...
                [WORKING_DIRECTORY <directory>]
                [TIMEOUT <seconds>]
                [RESULT_VARIABLE <variable>]
                [RESULTS_VARIABLE <variable>]
                [OUTPUT_VARIABLE <variable>]
                [ERROR_VARIABLE <variable>]
                [INPUT_FILE <file>]
                [OUTPUT_FILE <file>]
                [ERROR_FILE <file>]
                [OUTPUT_QUIET]
                [ERROR_QUIET]
                [COMMAND_ECHO <where>]
                [OUTPUT_STRIP_TRAILING_WHITESPACE]
                [ERROR_STRIP_TRAILING_WHITESPACE]
                [ENCODING <name>]
                [ECHO_OUTPUT_VARIABLE]
                [ECHO_ERROR_VARIABLE]
                [COMMAND_ERROR_IS_FATAL <ANY|LAST|NONE>])
